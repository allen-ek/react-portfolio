# Portfolio HTML/CSS webpage

## Why?
I wanted to create a portfolio page from scratch in order to better develop HTML CSS and React skills.  
I also wanted a basic web page so that I could easily display basic information as well as projects I have created.
I wanted to gain a depper understanding of React, HTML and CSS elements styling in order to create a more accesibile webpage that allowed for resizing of the webpage with the content ressizing.

## What I learned
While building this webpage I learned various React skills to build components as well as page layouts. I also learned how to manage state variables and form inputs. I also learned how to design a nav bar that allows for clinking of items to scroll to the apporpiate section on the webpage.
As well as creating a footer.
