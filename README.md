# Portfolio HTML/CSS webpage

## Why?
I wanted to create a portfolio page from scratch in order to better develop HTML and CSS skills.  
I also wanted a basic web page so that I could easily display basic information as well as projects I have created.
I wanted to gain a depper understanding of HTML and CSS elements styling in order to create a more accesibile webpage that allowed for resizing of the webpage with the content ressizing.

## What I learned
While building this webpage I learned various HTML techniques using flex and html anchor refrences in order to link images and apporpiate texts to relevant material. I also learned how to design a nav bar that allows for clinking of items to scroll to the apporpiate section on the webpage.
